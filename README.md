# Convolutional-Autoencoders
A research project on classifiying Handwritten digits using Semi-Supervised Learning

Domain: Deep Learning (Computer Vision)

We developed a Convolutional Autoencoder (Semi-Supervised Learning) model for Handwritten Digit Recognition using widely used MNIST dataset in Python which gave an accuracy above 98.9%.
The motivation behind doing this project was to get a Hands-on Experience on Deep Learning, learning how to build models and explore the lesser researched area in Machine Learning i.e. Semi-supervised Learning.
A thorough research was done on the topic “Convolutional Neural Networks using Semi-Supervised Learning” while implementing the project.

The repository consists of two notebooks one with Convolutional AutoEncoder code used for Unsupervised Learning where we used partial data as unlabeled data and trained the CAE, followed by the Classifier for Supervised Learning. The whole purpose was to see if the cascaded model of CAE and CNN outperforms a generic CNN model with architecture similar to encoder. We succeeded in doing so the cascaded model had an accuracy of around 98.9% as compared to the CNN model giving accuracy of 94%.
