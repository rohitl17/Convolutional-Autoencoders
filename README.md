# Convolutional-Autoencoders
A research project on classifiying Handwritten digits using Semi-Supervised Learning

Domain: Deep Learning (Computer Vision)

We developed a Convolutional Autoencoder (Semi-Supervised Learning) model for Handwritten Digit Recognition using widely used MNIST dataset in Python which gave an accuracy above 97%.
The motivation behind doing this project was to get a Hands-on Experience on Deep Learning, learning how to build models and explore the lesser researched area in Machine Learning i.e. Semi-supervised Learning.
A thorough research was done on the topic “Convolutional Neural Networks using Semi-Supervised Learning” while implementing the project.

Technologies used:Python(Keras),Tensorflow(backend),Jupyter
